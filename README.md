# SP-Homework00

**Task 1.** Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of
one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the
form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions `min` or
`max` while implementing your solution.

**Task 2.** Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns
the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than `n`.

**Task 3.** Give a single line command that computes the sum from `Task 2`, relying
on Python's comprehension syntax and the built-in `sum` function.

**Task 4.** Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns
the sum of the squares of all the odd positive integers smaller than `n`.

**Task 5.** Give a single line command that computes the sum from  `Task 4`, relying
on Python's comprehension syntax and the built-in `sum` function.
